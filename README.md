# The story of progress of the human race

The basic idea of the project is to tell a positive story about development
across the world in the human race.  In the 1960s there was clearly a huge
difference between the First world and the Third world. Life expectancy was
typically low and women used to give birth to higher number of children (due to
high rates of infant mortality etc.).  As societies grew affluent birth rates
tend to decrease and life expectancy increases.
 
We track the data of Fertility Rates, Life Expectancy and Population from
1960-2015.  All data was downloaded from https://data.worldbank.org/

The 1960s are when we first have data from different regions along the world.
We see a clear demarcation between developed European Union and North American
regions and regions like East Asia & Pacific (which comprises of China and
other Asian countries),South Asia  and  other regions. 


- The Y-axis is Life Expectancy
- The X-axis is Fertility Rate
- The size of the bubble is proportional to the population the region has as
  normalized to world population.
- Each frame of video represents a year from 1960-2015

#### In 1960
  - Low life expectancy 
  - High fertility
  - The size of the cirle is proportional to percentage of world population each region has
 
#### In 2015
  - Everyone is doing better !
  - Asian countries (the biggest chunk being China) have done a great job
    folowed by South Asian (India,Pakistan,Bagladesh & Sri Lanka) countries 
  - Although Sub-Sharan Africa has been rlaitvely slow paced relative to Asia
    (South Asia was more closer to Sub-Saharan Africa in 1960 vs. in 2015) and
the midddle east they are trending in the right direction

Special thanks to a TED Talk by Hans Rosling for inspring me to create this project.
